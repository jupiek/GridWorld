       Write a class DancingBug that “dances” by making different turns before

       The integer entries in the array represent how many times the bug turns before it moves. For example, an array entry of 5 represents a turn of 225 degrees (recall one turn is 45 degrees). When a dancing bug acts, it should turn the number of times given by the current array entry, then act like a Bug. In the next move, it should use the next entry in the array. After carrying out the last turn in the array, it should start again with the initial
